  "eligibility": "The M.Sc. course in Mathematics aims at developing mathematical ability in students with acute and abstract reasoning.  The course will enable students to cultivate a mathematician’s habit of thought and reasoning and will enlighten students with mathematical ideas relevant for oneself and for the course itself. COURSE DESIGN: Masters in Mathematics is a two year programme spreading over four semesters.  In the first two semesters focus is on the basic courses in mathematics such as Algebra, Topology, Analysis and Graph Theory along with the basic applied course ordinary and partial differential equations. In the third and fourth semester focus is on the special courses, elective courses and skill-based courses including Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration, Functional Analysis, Computational Fluid Mechanics, Advanced Graph Theory, Numerical Analysis and courses on Data Science. Important feature of the curriculum is that students can specialize in any one of areas (i) Fluid Mechanics, (ii) Graph Theory and (iii) Data Science, with a project on these topics in the fourth semester, which will help the students to pursue research in these topics or grab the opportunities in the industry. To gain proficiency in software skills, four Mathematics Lab papers are introduced one in each semester. viz. Introduction to FOSS tools,  Python Programming for Mathematics (for 2020-2022 batch) , Numerical Methods using Python and Numerical Methods for Boundary Value Problem using Python (for 2019-2021 batch) respectively.  Special importance is given to the skill enhancement courses Research Methodology, Machine Learning (for 2020-2022 batch), and Introduction to Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) Tools: (GNU Octave) (for 2019-2021 batch).\nPO1:\nEngage in continuous reflective learning in the context of technology and scientific advancement\nPO2:\nIdentify the need and scope of the Interdisciplinary research\nPO3:\nEnhance research culture and uphold the scientific integrity and objectivity\nPO4:\nUnderstand the professional, ethical and social responsibilities\nPO5:\nUnderstand the importance and the judicious use of technology for the sustainability of the environment\nPO6:\nEnhance disciplinary competency, employability and leadership skills\nPSO1:\nAttain mastery over pure and applied branches of Mathematics and its applications in multidisciplinary fields\nPSO2:\nDemonstrate problem solving, analytical and logical skills to provide solutions for the scientific requirements\nPSO3:\nDevelop critical thinking with scientific temper\nPSO4:\nCommunicate the subject effectively and express proficiency in oral and written communications to appreciate innovations in research\nPSO5:\nUnderstand the importance and judicious use of mathematical software's for the sustainable growth of mankind\nPS06:\nEnhance the research culture in three areas viz. Graph theory, Fluid Mechanics and Data Science and uphold the research integrity and objectivity\nProgramme Highlights",
