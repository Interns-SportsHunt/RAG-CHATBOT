Over the years, there has been a significant surge in the participation of women in sports and their pursuit of careers in this field. Notably, the 1900 Olympics in Paris had a mere 2.2% female participation, contrasting sharply with the 48.7% recorded in 2020. The historical narrative of women's involvement in sports reflects both triumphs and strides towards equality and empowerment, yet it also highlights persistent challenges such as compensation disparities, limited television coverage, and instances of body shaming. Against this backdrop, the Department of Economics organized a national conference on Women in Sports on 03.11.2023, focusing on discussions and research presentations encompassing leadership and inclusion of women, mental health of women athletes, social change through sports, visibility and voice of women, and holistic development, while addressing issues of gender discrimination.\nStudent Seminar Series: Advancing Economic Knowledge and Fostering Academic Exchange\nThe Department of Economics is set to host a fortnightly seminar series every Wednesday, featuring distinguished economists presenting their research findings across various economic domains.
