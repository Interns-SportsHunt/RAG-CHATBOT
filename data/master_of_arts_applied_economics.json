Upon successful completion of the programme, students will be awarded two degrees from two universities in two years with an international exposure of over four months in the USA. Since UC’s MS in Applied Economics is a ‘STEM’ degree, the students can work for up to three years without an H1-B visa through the facility of Optional Practical Training*.\nIn this student exchange, Semester 1, 2 and 3 would be taught as per CHRIST (Deemed to be University) syllabus and Semester 4 would be pursued at UC. The courses offered by UC are in two segments: in spring the courses are Time Series Econometrics, Game Theory, Competition and Regulation or Urban and Regional Economics (depending on faculty availability), Program Evaluation, Spatial Econometrics, Panel Data Econometrics and in summer a Masters Research Practicum.  Classes for UC’s MS in Applied Economics are held at the Lindner College of Business in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.\nThe selection for the dual degree programme is through a departmental internal selection process and would be open for those whose complete the academic requirements of the programme and have passed the GRE Exam.  Applicants with a GRE score of 320 or above will qualify for a $8000 scholarship.\nOptional Practical Training (OPT): OPT is a paid internship facility provided for international students under student visa (work visa is not required). The main purpose of OPT is to help students acquire practical experience in the field of their study. Normal duration of OPT is 12 months. However, students in STEM specializations can extend OPT by another two years (24 months).\nMA Economics, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)\nStudents in MA (Applied Economics) program can earn two Degrees in two years from two universities.

Upon successful completion of the second year (1+1) program at VCU, the students will be awarded the degree by VCU and on submission of VCU credits to CHRIST, the MA (Applied Economics) degree from CHRIST.\nMA in Economics at VCU is a quantitative-intensive program and is a ‘STEM’ degree. Students graduating from STEM program have attractive job opportunities.  International students in STEM programs can undertake a paid internship for up to three years without an H1-B visa through the facility of Optional Practical Training*.\nOptional Practical Training (OPT): OPT is a paid internship facility provided for international students under student visa (work visa is not required).
